Remember when git cloning to please run

```npm install```

This will get all of the npm packages that you need that were specified in the package.json that your system needs. (node_modules folder should not be put on GitHub! Too big!)


To install react-router please use the following command

```npm install @types/react-router-dom```


(If you googled this on your own you probably found this basic command:
npm i react-router-dom --save

But because we're using typescript we will get an error saying to use:
npm install @types/react-router-dom --save !)
